## Minimal AC'97 VirtualBox Sound driver for TinkerOS

This provides sounds similar to that of a PC Speaker mainly for VirtualBox which doesn't support the PC Speaker or awesome Adlib sounds that TinkerOS supports.

Notes:
- Performance will be bad if you don't have good hardware or are not using hardware acceleration for your virtual machine.
- This is mainly for Windows people, if you're running Linux it will work, but you will get much better sound if you, compile the VMusic extension and use Adlib instead!
